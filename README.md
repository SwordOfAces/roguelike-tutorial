Using the [TCOD Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/) and doing it as part of the [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev) 2019 summer event

I'll be following fairly tightly, as I'm also using Python 3 and tcod, though I'll take opportunities for personal spin, but the goal will be to have 1) a completed project that could work as a base of knowledge to write a second one, and 2) something that may be extensible and moddable. 

Dependencies:
 - Python 3
 - tcod v11.0.0 (see TCOD Roguelike Tutorial for installing)
